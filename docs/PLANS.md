# Plans

Plans are first-class artifacts. The product-manager agent creates them during
Discovery. The principal-engineer agent fills in the Design section. The
engineering-manager agent manages their lifecycle.

## Design

## Plan lifecycle

1. Created in `active/` by the product-manager agent during Discovery
2. Design section filled by the principal-engineer agent
3. Task breakdown added by the engineering-manager agent
4. Progress log updated during Implementation
5. Acceptance criteria checked by the product-manager agent during Acceptance
6. Moved to `completed/` by the engineering-manager agent when Done
